# Readme
This repository contains code to model the point surface energy balance (SEB) on a glacier. The code forms the basis 
of the energy balance example in Matthews et al. (2020). 


Briefly: 

- 'core.py' contains the core numerical routines for solving the energy balance 
- 'seb_utils.py' has helper functions to manipulate the met data
- 'run_seb.py' provides an example invocation of the routines to compute the energy balance (and melt/ablation)
