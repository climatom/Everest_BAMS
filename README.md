# Readme
This repository contains code related to the analysis in Matthews et al. (2020) [Full reference to follow at the time of writing]. 

The code-base (and repository) is likely to grow as further analysis is pursued to develop the examples introduced by their initial study. 

Any questions about the project or code should be directed to t.matthews@lboro.ac.uk or climatom86@gmail.com
